* ### Client Stories

    * ### Client Goals

    * #### "As the site owner.."

        * ..**'and Photographer'**, it is critical that all photographic content displays optimally, irrespective of the device size/type/resolution used to access the site.

        * I would like visitors to be able to contact me via my email to discuss potential commissions, collaboration or buying prints.

        * I would like to offer tablet and desktop users the opportunity to view larger, higher resolution images than is possible on social media platforms, to provide a more intimate viewing experience.

        * I would like a site that is photo-centric - with images given room to breath without being overwhelmed by large bodies of text.

        * I need a site that is professional, as it is a representation of both me and my work. This requires close attention to detail, including:
            * A coherent, balanced layout.

            * Tasteful, appropriate typography - to support the images, without stealing the limelight.

            * All links and navigation elements must function correctly.
            
            * Avoiding typos / spelling / grammar mistakes that would distract from the site's photographic content.

        * It is important that the site sits comfortably within the genre of photographer / artist websites, while offering a playful twist or splash of character in the site design and aesthetic.


## Design

### Colour Scheme
* As the site is intended as a space for the appreciation of photography, pages are mostly built atop an off-white background, framed by a white navigation bar, with black name/logo and toggle button. The introduction of a subtle drop shadow separates the navbar from the page content without introducing an abrupt border or coloured navbar that would distract from the photographs. 

* While I chose to keep the navigation and pages white, I was keen to introduce some character in small splashes of color in certain page elements, including a custom scrollbar and link/toggle 'hover:' psuedo states. It may at first seem to betray my philosophy about keeping elements white to allow the photos space to breath. However, my rational is that any splashes or pops of colour are only introduced when interacting with a navigation element - at a time when your attention has already shifted away from the photographs. 

### Typography
* Adobe Fonts Library was used to source all fonts used in the project. 

* For all headings, links and the navbar-brand logo I selected the font-family Futura. Futura is considered a timeless classic of the font world, looking just as modern today as when it was released by The Bauer Type Foundry in 1927. Being a sans-serif typeface, Futura boasts a clean, modern look which makes it perfect for statement text such as logos, titles and headlines. I opted to also use it for my navigation menu items, as it lends them some weight, without appearing too blocky - due to the font-weight and size.

### Imagery
* All photographs are the work of the Artist / Developer.

## Wireframes
* Home Page Wireframe - 'View'
* Mobile Page Wireframe - 'View'
* Contact Page Wireframe - 'View'
etc..

## Features
* The site is responsive across all device sizes and viewports, from the very small iPhone-SE (original) to 27" 4k desktop monitors. 
* .. ....

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
1. [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
* Bootstrap was utilised to aid in the styling of key website elements such as the Navigation Bar and for it's powerful responsive layout tools such as the row and column classes. I opted for Bootstrap version 4.6 over the recently release 5.0 to ensure stability.
2. [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)
* Adobe Fonts was used for typography across the site. Font-families were imported into the style.css stylesheet file. 'Futura' was selected as a display font, and 'Kabel Neue' for body copy and links.
3. [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/)
* Adobe Color helped in the selection of color-schemes and extracting gradients from images used on the site. This helped to thematically align and support the photographic content with the site elements and interface.
4. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* Adobe Photoshop was used extensively in the editing, resizing and export of the projects many image assets.
5. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* jQuery was utilised to power Bootstrap's responsive navbar. Also used for Javascript's smooth scroll function.
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Git was utilised version control, via the Gitpod terminal for commiting file changes to Git before pushing to the GitHub repository.
7. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* GitHub provided a place to store the projects various files and assets after being commited and pushed from Git.
8. [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
* Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes for the initial design, to show the layout and basic elements of the site.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section 
* #### First Time Visitor Goals
    
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I would like confirmation that I have come to the right place - visible in the form of a name or logo."
 
    * Upon arriving at the site's landing page, users are immediately greeted with a logo, displaying the Artist's name in the reassuringly confident "Futura" font.
    
    * This is reaffirmed when navigating to the home page (index.html), where a logo is clearly visible on the site's navigation bar at the top-left of the page.
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I would like to be greeted with an attention-grabbing photograph that sparks my interest, encouraging me to stay and further explore the site."
 
    * Upon arriving at the site's landing page, users are immediately greeted with a large 'hero' background image, that cycles to a new image every few seconds on a "keyframe slider" animation. Upon clicking the logo and arriving at the index page, visitors are met with more photos to peruse.
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I expect the site to be intuitive to use and easy to explore.
 
    * The site layout has been designed to offer users frictionless site exploration, using clear and uncluttered navigation menus that are easy to find from anywhere on the page. The core navigation and element styles remain consistent across various pages and device viewports to put the user at ease and encourage a longer stay at the site - and future visits.
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I expect a pleasant browsing experience regardless of the device I access the site from."
 
    * As the owner of an aging iPhone-SE, I understand the frustration that users suffer when a website displays incorrectly, incompletely or simply doesn't function at all when visited on very small devices. To counter this, the site is designed with a "mobile-first" ethos, adding extra space and/or content for tablet and desktop users - rather than simply trying to squeeze a desktop site on a mobile display.
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I would prefer that any external links or downloads open in a separate tab/window to prevent accidental navigation away from the site."
 
    * The site's links comprise of an email-address, social media links and a PDF copy of my MFA thesis. All links are instructed to open in a new tab using the target="_blank" syntax.
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I would like to be provided with links to the artist's social media account/s to view their recent work."
    
    * Links to social media are available on the about page, represented by font-awesome icons. 
 
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I would like page content to load quickly."
    
    * For fast loading times, and eliminate frustration that may see users to leave prematurely, I have created custom image assets of varying resolutions to optimise page 
    loading times for each of the main breakpoints. The images are delivered using the 'srcset' attribute in the html document.  When encountering srcset, the browser 
    determines the most appropriate file-size to deliver, depending on the user's device viewport. This ensures images display at an appropriate resolution, while reducing 
    unnecessary data use for visitors.
    
    #### "As a First Time Visitor, I don't want to worry about image-heavy websites draining my mobile data when visiting the site away from WIFI networks."

    * As explained in the previous user story, I have employed custom image assets at various sizes appropriate to each device viewport size, including smaller file sizes for mobile users. 
    This ensures that images are delivered quickly and reduces demands on a user's mobile data usage - all without reducing the perceived quality of the photos, or the experience of viewing them.


* #### Returning Visitor Goals
    * #### "As a Returning Visitor, I would like to know about buying prints of the artist's work, and details about the printing process."
        
        * On the About page there is a statement that lets visitors know that they can buy prints, and inviting them to get in touch via the email link provided.

        * "As a Returning Visitor, I would like to know how to contact the artist with any questions or correspondence."
            
        * The Contact page includes an invitation for interested parties to email with any enquiries relating to collaboration, commissions or print orders.

* #### Frequent Visitor Goals

    * #### "As a Frequent Visitor, I would like to see periodic content updates to the site, providing fresh content and information about upcoming exhibitions, projects etc."
    
        * This one is harder to address immediately, as the site is not yet live. However, my plan is to make regular updates to the page, in the form of extra galleries that are added as
        unique pages, then linked through the Projects page and navigation menu. Eventually older gallery pages may, if desired, be retired from the site - or moved to separate site 'archive' or similar.

* #### Client Goals

    * #### As both site owner _and_ photographer, it is critical that all photographic content displays optimally, irrespective of the device size/type/resolution used to access the site."
         
        * I have effectively solved three goals by employing the 'srcset' attribute to deliver image assets across the site. Two of those were user goals - namely, faster load-times and lower data use. 
        However, it is equally important to me as the site owner - as it ensures that the optimal image asset is deployed to match the device it is viewed on. This ensures that images look their best,
        while also improving the users experience by speeding up the loading times which encourages them to explore the site for longer.

    * #### "I would like visitors to be able to contact me via my email to discuss potential commissions, collaboration or buying prints."
        
        * I have supplied a direct link to my email on the contact page with an invitation to contact me. I have styled my email link to be a different color from the body text to make it easier to spot. 
        I decided to make it an anchor link to give people the option of clicking it directly if they choose - but I also gave my email address as the anchor text, so people could copy or note down the address
        for their records if they prefer to enter the address directly in their email client later.
    
    * #### "As site owner, I would like to offer tablet and desktop users the opportunity to view larger, higher resolution images than is possible on social media platforms, to provide a more intimate viewing experience."
        


    * "As site owner, I would like a site that is photo-centric - with images given room to breath without being overwhelmed by large bodies of text."
        
        * 
    
    * "As site owner, I need a site that is professional. This requires close attention to detail, including:
            * A coherent, balanced layout.

            * Tasteful typography.

            * All links and navigation elements must function correctly.
            
            * Avoiding typos / spelling / grammar mistakes that would distract from the site's photographic content."
        * 
    
    5.  "As site owner, it is important that the site sits comfortably within the genre of photographer / artist websites, while offering the odd playful twist or splash of character in the site design and aesthetic."
