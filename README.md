# Thomas McQuillan | Artist Website 

[View the live website here.](https://thomasmcquillan.github.io/Milestone-One-Project/landing-page.html)

This site is designed as a bespoke online portfolio for my photography.  An online presence is essential for artists and designers, offering a platform 
from which to communicate their ideas and aesthetic style, while also exhibiting a mastery of their craft. In contrast to many websites that are trying to 
sell products or maintain visitors attention, artist sites often embrace a strategy of 'less-is-more'. The work is left to speak for itself, rejecting 
modern baubles like pop-up modals, forms, icons or buttons.

* ## Client Stories

    * ### Client Goals

        * As site owner _and_ photographer, it is critical that all photographic content displays optimally, irrespective of the device size/type/resolution used to access the site.

        * As site owner I would like visitors to be able to contact me via my email to discuss potential commissions, collaboration or buying prints.

        * As site owner I would like to offer tablet and desktop users the opportunity to view larger, higher resolution images than is possible on social media platforms, to provide a more intimate viewing experience.

        * As site owner I want my site to be photo-centric - with a layout that provides images room to breath without being overwhelmed by large bodies of text.

        * As site owner I require that the site looks professional. That is not to say that it should be devoid of character, but rather it requires attention to detail, including:

            * A coherent, balanced layout.

            * Tasteful typography - to support the images, without stealing the limelight.

            * All links and navigation elements must function correctly.
                
            * Avoiding typos / spelling / grammar mistakes that would distract from the site's photographic content.

        * As site owner it is important that the website sits happily within the genre of artist/photographer websites, while still offering the odd playful twist and a sense of character."


## Design

* ### Colour Scheme
    * As the site is intended as a space for the appreciation of photography, pages function much like a gallery wall - adopting an off-white background, framed by a white navigation bar, with black name/logo and toggle button. The introduction of a subtle drop shadow separates the navbar from the page content without introducing an abrupt border or coloured navbar that would distract from the photographs. 

    * While I chose to keep the navigation and pages white, I was keen to introduce some character in small splashes of color in certain page elements, including a custom scrollbar and link/toggle 'hover:' psuedo states. It may at first seem to betray my philosophy about keeping elements white to allow the photos space to breath. However, my rational is that any splashes or pops of colour are only introduced when interacting with a navigation element - at a time when your attention has already shifted away from the photographs. 

*   ![Thematic color choices](https://thomasmcquillan.github.io/Milestone-One-Project/assets/documentation/readme-image-assets/color-for-thematic-goals.jpeg "Thomas McQuillan's Portfolio Website")


* ### Typography
    * Adobe Fonts Library was used to source all fonts used in the project. 

    * For all headings, links and the navbar-brand logo I selected the font-family Futura. Futura is considered a timeless classic of the font world, looking just as modern today as when it was released by The Bauer Type Foundry in 1927. Being a sans-serif typeface, Futura boasts a clean, modern look which makes it perfect for statement text such as logos, titles and headlines. I opted to also use it for my navigation menu items, as it lends them some weight, without appearing too blocky - due to the font-weight and size.

*   ![Adobe Fonts - Acumin Pro Light](https://thomasmcquillan.github.io/Milestone-One-Project/assets/documentation/adobe-acumin-pro-light-font.jpeg) "Adobe's Acumin Pro Light typeface, as used in Navigation menu and Brand")

    * Despite my site being intentionally light in text elements, I was cognizant of the importance of not the just readability of body copy, but also the mood it lends to the site as a whole.

* ### Imagery
    * All photographs are the work of the Artist / Developer.

## Wireframes
* The wireframes for the project were designed in Adobe XD. The site design has changed in key ways over the project - which is evidently a real and serious challenge when the developer is also the client. The desire to 
get everything looking exactly as you would like can overwhelm and draw out the whole project. Such scope creep would usually be either impossible - or potentially very costly to the client. The cost in this case was born by
myself in the extra hours, days and weeks it added to the process. However, I wanted everything just right so I was willing to take the time to get there. The development itself was relatively straightforward in comparison to 
the aesthetic design decisions.

* Below is an image of the site as a whole, as conceived at the project outset. To see each page and element in greater detail, please vist the linked files here:

## Features
* The site is responsive across all device sizes and viewports, from the very small iPhone-SE (original) to 27" 4k desktop monitors. 
* The site's images have been created with responsivity as a primary goal to ensure photographs look their very best, while reducing loading times and data usage on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
1. [Bootstrap 4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
* Bootstrap was utilised to aid in the styling of key website elements such as the Navigation Bar and for it's powerful responsive layout tools such as the row and column classes. I opted for Bootstrap version 4.6 over the recently release 5.0 to ensure stability.
2. [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)
* Adobe Fonts was used for typography across the site. Font-families were imported into the style.css stylesheet file. 'Futura' was selected as a display font, and 'Kabel Neue' for body copy and links.
3. [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/)
* Adobe Color helped in the selection of color-schemes and extracting gradients from images used on the site. This helped to thematically align and support the photographic content with the site elements and interface.
4. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* Adobe Photoshop was used extensively in the editing, resizing and export of the projects many image assets.
5. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* jQuery was utilised to power Bootstrap's responsive navbar. Also used for Javascript's smooth scroll function.
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Git was utilised version control, via the Gitpod terminal for commiting file changes to Git before pushing to the GitHub repository.
7. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* GitHub provided a place to store the projects various files and assets after being commited and pushed from Git.
8. [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
* Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes for the initial design, to show the layout and basic elements of the site.

* ### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section 

* #### First Time Visitor Goals
    
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I would like confirmation that I have come to the right place - visible in the form of a name or logo."
 
        * Upon arrival at the site's landing page, users are immediately greeted with a 'logo', in the form of the artist's name in the "Futura" font.
        
        * This is reaffirmed when navigating to the home page (index.html), where a logo is clearly visible on the site's navigation bar at the top-left of the page.
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I would like to be greeted with an attention-grabbing photograph that sparks my interest, encouraging me to stay and further explore the site."
        * Upon arrival at the site's landing page, users are immediately greeted with a large 'hero' background image, that cycles to a new image every few seconds on a "keyframe slider" animation. Upon clicking the logo and arriving at the index page, visitors are met with more photos to peruse.
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I expect the site to be intuitive to use and easy to explore.
 
        * The site layout has been designed to offer users frictionless site exploration, using clear and uncluttered navigation menus that are easy to find from anywhere on the page. The core navigation and element styles remain consistent across various pages and device viewports to put the user at ease and encourage a longer stay at the site - and future visits.
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I expect a pleasant browsing experience regardless of the device I access the site from."
 
        * As the owner of an aging iPhone-SE, I understand the frustration that users suffer when a website displays incorrectly, incompletely or simply doesn't function at all when visited on very small devices. To counter this, the site is designed with a "mobile-first" ethos, adding extra space and/or content for tablet and desktop users - rather than simply trying to squeeze a desktop site on a mobile display.
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I would prefer that any external links or downloads open in a separate tab/window to prevent accidental navigation away from the site."
 
        * The site's links comprise of an email-address, social media links and a PDF copy of my MFA thesis. All links are instructed to open in a new tab using the target="_blank" syntax.
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I would like to be provided with links to the artist's social media account/s to view their recent work."
    
        * Links to social media are available on the about page, represented by font-awesome icons. 
 
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I would like page content to load quickly."
    
        * For fast loading times, and eliminate frustration that may see users to leave prematurely, I have created custom image assets of varying resolutions to optimise page 
        loading times for each of the main breakpoints. The images are delivered using the 'srcset' attribute in the html document.  When encountering srcset, the browser 
        determines the most appropriate file-size to deliver, depending on the user's device viewport. This ensures images display at an appropriate resolution, while reducing 
        unnecessary data use for visitors.
    
    * #### "As a first time visitor, I don't want to worry about image-heavy websites draining my mobile data when visiting the site away from WIFI networks."

        * As explained in the previous user story, I have employed custom image assets at various sizes appropriate to each device viewport size, including smaller file sizes for mobile users. 
        This ensures that images are delivered quickly and reduces demands on a user's mobile data usage - all without reducing the perceived quality of the photos, or the experience of viewing them.


* #### Returning Visitor Goals
    * #### "As a returning visitor, I would like to know if it is possible to purchase prints of the artist's photographs, as well as details about the printing process."
        
        * On the About page there is a statement that lets visitors know that they can buy prints, and inviting them to get in touch via the email link provided. Information is provided
        with details of the paper's brand, weight, finish and archival properties. I would like to eventually implement online print purchasing functionality but that is out of scope for this project.

    * #### "As a returning visitor, I would like to know how to contact the artist with any questions or correspondence."
            
        * The Contact page includes an invitation for interested parties to email with any enquiries relating to collaboration, commissions or print orders.

* #### Frequent Visitor Goals

    * #### "As a frequent visitor, I would like to see periodic content updates to the site, providing fresh content and information about upcoming exhibitions, projects etc."
    
        * This one is harder to address immediately, as the site is not yet live. However, my plan is to make regular updates to the page, in the form of extra galleries that are added as
        unique pages, then linked through the Projects page and navigation menu. Eventually older gallery pages may, if desired, be retired from the site to make way for new content.

* #### Client Goals

    * #### "As both site owner _and photographer_, it is critical that all photographic content displays optimally, irrespective of the device size/type/resolution used to access the site."
         
        * I have effectively solved three goals by employing the 'srcset' attribute to deliver image assets across the site. Site visitors benefited on two fronts - namely, faster load-times and lower data use. 
        However, it is equally important to me as the site owner - as it ensures that the optimal image asset is deployed to match the device it is viewed on. This ensures that images look their best,
        while also improving the users experience by speeding up the loading times which encourages them to explore the site for longer. I have also added '2x' image assets, to accommodate for displays with
        higher pixel-density such as the Apple Retina displays. Had I not, then the images would have appeared slightly 'soft' on these devices, which I wouldn't like. More info on "1x/2x/3x" resolutions here: 
        <br><br><https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/image-size-and-resolution/>

    * #### "I would like visitors to be able to contact me via my email to discuss potential commissions, collaboration or buying prints."
        
        * I have supplied a direct link to my email on the contact page with an invitation to contact me. I have styled my email link to be a different color from the body text to make it easier to spot. 
        I decided to make it an anchor link to give people the option of clicking it directly if they choose - but I also gave my email address as the anchor text, so people could copy or note down the address
        for their records if they prefer to enter the address directly in their email client later.
    
    * #### "As site owner, I would like to offer tablet and desktop users the opportunity to view larger, higher resolution images than is possible on social media platforms, to provide a more intimate viewing experience."
        
        * I have provided images at both a good size and resolution for all devices. This extends to an maximum display-width of 1400px (2400px for 2x displays) for the largest images when viewed on desktop computers. 


    * #### "As site owner, I want my site to be photo-centric - with a layout that provides images room to breath without being overwhelmed by large bodies of text."
        
        * I have attempted to keep images as the primary focus, with text elements providing support to the images, lightly guiding visitors around the site rather than seeking to explain. This is consistent
        with artist website conventions.
    
    * #### "As site owner I require that the site looks professional.." (abridged)

        * I have made every effort to try and keep my code clean, and my content polished. This includes everything from correctly sized and positioned images to meticulously scanning text sections to ensure no 
        careless typos or grammatical errors could slip through unnoticed. I am confident that my layout and typographic choices complement and support the images, without speaking too strongly themselves.
        I have tested and retested all links and navigation elements extensively across a wide variety of devices to ensure I didn't encounter any bugs or display issues that might arise.
    
    * #### "As site owner it is important that the website sits happily within the genre of artist/photographer websites, while still offering the odd playful twist and a sense of character."
        
        * From the outset I was keen to develop a site that could function as a bespoke online space where I can host a selection of my best photographic work. Often the greatest difficulty for artists and 
        designers is not deciding what to keep in, but what to leave out. Sure, it is important to provide enough content - but too much and you risk diluting the message. This challenge manifested not only
        in deciding how many photos to include, but given that my interests extend throughout art and design, it was tempting to expand my project to include non-photographic works. However I came to 
        realise that such scope-creep could easily derail the project's original vision. I think the resulting project negotiates an uneasy threshold between the loose conventions of 
        modern artist websites and a playful space of greater character.

## Further Testing
* The site was tested on all major browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
* The site was viewed on a number of devices, each with varied display sizes, resolutions and viewport-widths. These included devices as small as the original iPhoneSE, the larger iPhoneXR, an iPadPro, MacBook Pro 13" & 16" - right up to a 27" 4k monitor.
* Extensive testing was carried out to check that all navigation links to site pages, external sites and downloadable content were functioning correctly.
* Close scrutiny was paid to each page to ensure that no spelling errors or other inconsistencies were present.
* Friends, family members and the slack community were all asked to look through the site and associated documentation to give feedback and report on any bugs. 

## Known Bugs
* The page content sometimes appears momentarily above the navbar when scrolling quickly up the page from the bottom on an iPhone SE. I checked it on an ipadPro where it happened as well.
However, I was able to force the same behaviour on a number of other websites so must be a browser / application quirk.
