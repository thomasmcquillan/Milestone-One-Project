## Site Purpose & Philosophy

This site is designed as a bespoke online portfolio for my photography.  A web-presence is essential for artists and design professionals. Well designed and executed, it provides a potent tool for communicating an artist's ideas and aesthetic style, while also showcasing their mastery of their chosen craft.

    * ### Site Owner Goals

    * #### As Site Owner:

        * It is essential that all photographs display optimally, irrespective of the size/type/resolution of the device the site is accessed from.

        * I want to give tablet and desktop visitors the chance to view large, high resolution images to provide a more immersive experience than is possible on social media sites such as instagram.

        * It is important that the images are given space to 'breath', as when viewed in a gallery space.

        * I want a site that is 'photo-centric' - prioritising quality image content over large amounts of explanatory text or information, as is the convention with artist websites.

        * As site owner, it is important that the site sits happily within the genre of other photographer / artist websites, while offering the odd playful twist or fresh flavor in it's layout and aesthetic.

        * I need a site that is professional, with great attention to detail. This includes..
            * A coherent, balanced layout.
            * Great typography, using timeless typefaces selected from font-libraries.
            * All links and navigation elements must work as expected.
            * Both graphic and text elements should be appropriately proportioned and positioned to provide the best visitor experience.
            * Avoiding careless typos or spelling mistakes that may distract from visitors' enjoyment of the site's photographic content.
