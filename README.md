# Artist Portfolio - Thomas McQuillan



## Site Purpose & Philosophy

This site is designed as an online showcase of my work as a photographer.  A web-presence has become an essential asset to artists, photographers, designers and other creative professionals. It is a space where they can quickly and effectively communicate their ideas and aesthetic style, while also exhibiting a command of their chosen discipline. 

There exists an ever-growing list of templates and subscription services that can be utilised to build personal websites, including Squarespace, WordPress, Wix etc. These are typically built upon a catalogue of existing templates, which are nicely designed, responsive and undeniably convenient. However, they carry the risk of your site appearing similar to others, maybe a little generic and lacking impact. In recent years social media has presented itself as a fertile channel for businesses and creative professionals to market themselves and reach a wider audience than what was previously possible. This democratisation of advertising has been transformational for individuals and small businesses, as it is very often cheap or free and makes it easier to reach your target market or demographic. 

Instagram has become a dominant platform in the online photo-sharing scene, with many photographers assuming that having an Instagram account renders a stand-alone website unnecessary or superfluous.  Despite Instagram’s immense popularity and image-centric structure - the platform could be considered as more like a ‘tasting-plate’.  A safe, accessible space for users to discover and get a feel for a photographer or artist’s work. However, the platform doesn’t encourage staying for a longer look, with the user quickly whisked away to the photo-stream of some other artist/company/influencer on the giddy ferris-wheel of Instagram’s click-happy algorithms. 

By contrast, my website is designed as a space for visitors to come and view some of my best work, in a layout custom built to show the photographs in their best light. Opting for quality over quantity, I have curated a smaller series from some of my best work and rejected instagram’s endless 3-column grid, preferring to allow the images room to breath. It is hoped that this will encourage a calmer pace, allowing them to really engage with the content. Likewise, the navigation bar and menus are always easily accessible and intuitive, but also styled to be unobtrusive and understated.


## UX

### User Stories

As a visitor to this site I want/need/expect:

1. To be greeted with a striking, interesting or otherwise engaging photograph that catches my attention and encourages me to stay at the site and explore further pages and content.

2. For there to be immediate assurance that I have arrived at the right place, visible in the form of a name or logo in the navigation bar or header.

3. For there to be a simple, refined and considered layout to provide a calm, yet engaging viewing experience.

4. To arrive at a website that is intuitive to use, where all navigation menus and links are both easily accessible and function correctly.

5. As a tablet or desktop user I would like the opportunity to view the photographs at a reasonable scale and resolution to allow me to inspect and appreciate more of the photographs’ details and nuances than is typically possible on sites like Instagram. A photographer’s images are the very reason that the site exists - so it is critical that every attention is given to exhibit their best qualities.

6. That any external links or downloadable content such as PDFs will open in a new window or tab to prevent accidental navigation away from the website.

7. To have all text content presented in a balanced and elegant layout, in a typeface that is both clearly legible and consistent with the tone of the photographic content.

8. For there not to be any visible typos, grammatical errors, or spelling mistakes that may distract from, or negatively affect the appreciation of the photographic work.

9. For the website to display in a balanced layout regardless of what device I am using when navigating to the site. 

10. For the images to load at an appropriate scale and resolution for the device I am on at the time.  This includes the ability to enjoy a larger version of images when on tablets or desktop computers, but equally to save data and deliver faster loading times when viewing on a mobile device.

11. I would like the opportunity to buy quality limited-edition prints of the artist’s work, and information about the paper stock and printing process used.

12. As a visitor to the site I would like to have an easy to find link to the artist’s instagram account to see more of their photographs, including more recent work.

13. I would like it to be easy to contact the artist, should I have any questions about ordering prints, collaborative projects or commissions. Ideally this would be available in a simple, easy to complete contact form to avoid the hassle of copying the artist’s email address to message them in a separate email tab or application.

14. While a contact form is convenient, it would also be useful to know the artist's email address should I want to contact them directly with a longer, more detailed message or to follow up about a previous enquiry.
