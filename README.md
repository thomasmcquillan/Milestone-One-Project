# Artist Portfolio



## Site Purpose & Philosophy

This site is designed as a bespoke online portfolio for my photography.  A web-presence is essential for artists and design professionals. Well designed and executed, it provides a potent tool for communicating an artist's ideas and aesthetic style, while also showcasing their mastery of their chosen craft.

## UX

### User Stories

As a visitor to this site I would like:

* To be greeted with a photograph that grabs my attention and encourages further exploration of the site.

* To be sure that I have arrived in the right place, visible in the form of a name or logo.

* For there to be a simple, refined and considered layout to provide a calm, yet engaging viewing experience.

* For the site navigation and page content to be intuitive to use.

* For the site to display and function equally well across all devices.

* For links or downloads to open in a separate tab/window so I don't accidentally navigate away from the site.

* For all text to be clear and legible, with all text appropriately styled, sized and laid out.

* To have the chance to buy prints of the artistâ€™s work, and information about the printing process.

* To have a link to the artist's instagram account to view their recent work.

* An easy way to contact the artist to discuss collaborative projects, commissions or ordering prints. 

### Client Goals

As the owner of this site I would like:

* For all images to look their very best, irrespective of the device the site is accessed from. This includes:
  * The ability to enjoy large images on tablets or desktops.

  * To conserve mobile data and deliver faster loading times when viewing on a mobile device.

  * The photographs should always have adquate 'room to breath' much like in an art gallery. As a photography portfolio, the layout should be photo-centric - therefore, reducing the number of columns is always preferable to squeezing images into a tight space.

* The site must look professional. A coherent, balanced layout with considered use of fonts is essential. However, equally important is attention to detail. This avoids introducing careless typos, grammatical errors, or spelling mistakes that would distract visitors from the site's photographic content.
